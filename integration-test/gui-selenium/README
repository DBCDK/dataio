To start all services on which the GUI depends for development mode, issue the following maven command:

    mvn -P dev verify

This will start an embedded glassfish with all services deployed and an h2 tcpserver for database connectivity. Per default the glassfish runs on port 8080 and the h2 tcpserver on port 8181.

Default ports can be overridden like so:

    mvn -Dglassfish.port=6666 -Dh2.port=6667 -P dev verify

Make sure all service .war's have been built before issuing above commands.

When running GWT developer mode, make sure that the flowStoreURL system property is set to point to the flow-store-service instance, ie. -DflowStoreURL=http://localhost:8080/flow-store

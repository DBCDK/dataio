The official json-diff io.github.deblockt:json-diff:1.0.1 found on maven search has been build for Java 17.

Right now we are on Java 11, but are about to upgrade to 17, so as a very temporary solution,
this package is included as source code (The code works as is on Java 11).
It SHOULD be deleted and added as a dependency instead, as soon as possible

The dataIO Gatekeeper daemon works by monitoring a specified directory for file
system changes.

When a transfile (*.trans) is determined to be complete (i.e. it contains the
'slut' end marker) the number of required modifications (file system changes,
dataIO job creation etc.) are firstly stored in a write-ahead-log kept in
gatekeeper.wal.* files in the daemons current working directory. Subsequently
the modifications are locked and executed sequentially.

In case of shutdown the daemon will try its best to finish any ongoing
operation and leave the system in a consistent state. Although in the case of
an abrupt termination system corruption may occur, and the write-ahead-log
should contain an already locked modification and the daemon will refuse to
start. It is then up to the operations people to resolve these situations
manually.

When all modifications have completed successfully the transfile and its
corresponding data file(s) will no longer be present in the directory and the
write-ahead-log will be empty.



Usage for the gatekeeper daemonen:

$> java -jar dataio-gatekeeper.jar -h
usage: java -jar <jarfile>
 -d,--guarded-dir <dir>              Path of directory guarded by this gatekeeper instance
 -f,--file-store-service-url <url>   Base URL of file-store service
 -j,--job-store-service-url <url>    Base URL of job-store service
 -s,--shadow-dir <dir>               Path of shadow directory
 -h,--help                           Produce help message

The 'guarded-dir' is the directory monitored for file system changes.

The 'shadow-dir' is where files destined for the old 'posthus' system are
moved to.

The 'file-store-service-url' and 'job-store-service-url' are used to reach
the REST services needed for dataIO job creation.

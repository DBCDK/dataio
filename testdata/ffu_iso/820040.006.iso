Creswell explores the philosophical underpinnings, history, and key elements of each of five qualitative inquiry traditions: narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case study. In his signature writing style, the author relates research designs to each of the traditions of inquiry in a highly accessible manner. He compares theoretical frameworks, ways to employ standards of quality, and strategies for writing introductions to studies, collecting data, analyzing data, writing a narrative, and verifying results.--Publisher description000aIntroduction -- Philosophical assumptions and interpretive frameworks -- Designing a qualitative study -- Five qualitative approaches to inquiry -- Five different qualitative studies -- Introducing and focusing the study -- Data collection -- Data analysis and representation -- Writing a qualitative study -- Standards of validation and evaluation -- "Turning the story" and conclusion -- Appendix A.

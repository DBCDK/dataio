Professionals in this field need a more dynamic, systematic and multidisciplinary approach. Written by an international group of experts, Coastal Risk Assessment and Mitigation in a Changing Climate provides innovative, multidisciplinary best practices for mitigating the effects of climate change on coastal structures. Based on the Theseus program, the book includes eight study sites across Europe, with specific attention to the most vulnerable coastal environments such as deltas, estuaries and wetlands, where many large cities and industrial areas are located"--000aMethodology for Risk assessment Engineering Mitigation Technologies Ecologically-Based Mitigation Measures Socio-Economic Mitigation Measures Risk Assessment and Mitigation in THESEUS Study Sites Towards Sustainable Decision-Making000akat151005000gBSIfBSI000d0001000a14102816103108000aKystsikringaKlimaændringeraRisikovurderingaMiljøbeskyttelse000aCoastal zone managementvCase studies000aCoast changesxRisk assessmentvCase studies000aClimatic changesxRisk assessmentvCase studies000aCoastal engineeringvCase studies000aZanuttighhBarbara4edt

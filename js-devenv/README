Downloading
-----------

A dataIO javascript acceptance test environment can be obtained by calling:

    svn co https://svn.dbc.dk/repos/dataio/trunk/js-devenv


Documentation
-------------

Install acceptance test environment on a server where the is.dbc.dk package is already setup by calling:

    ./configure

Run acceptance test(s) which must be located in a 'testsuites' directory by calling:

    ./js-acctest /path/to/testsuites-file-or-directory

Note that paths specified in testsuite files pointing to test data and javascript must be relative to the testsuite
file in question.


This software bundle also contains the (hopefully) soon-to-be deprecated scripts setup_devenv.sh and run_acctest.sh
targeted specifically at datawell-convert project acceptance testing.

By calling

    ./setup_devenv.sh

an acceptance test environment is created in which the datawell-convert and jsshell-acctest projects are downloaded into
a directory called 'svn.dbc.dk'.

Run these datawell-convert acceptance test(s) by calling:

    ./run_acctest.sh svn.dbc.dk/jsshell-acctest/path/to/testsuites-file-or-directory
